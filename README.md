Full web page markup process recorder in video
==============

Source files of video recorded (~3 hours) full web page markup process. [MCSS](http://operatino.github.io/MCSS/en/), Grunt, Less, IE8+.

All paths to resources are absolute, to see a currect result in browser run `html` folder on any http server or visit [demo page](http://operatino.github.io/markup-process).

##Possible improvements:

* Responsive design for small screens (+1 hour)
* Optimization and build process for production launch as a static page (sprites, css/html optimization, +1 hour)

if somebody is interested, I can record dev process of listed improvements and publish it either.
